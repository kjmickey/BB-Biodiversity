# BB-Biodiversity
 Bootcampspot belly button homework


Use plotly to create a dashboard of different bacteria in different test subject's navels.

The live site is at https://kjmickey.github.io/BB-Biodiversity/index.html

I had to fiddle quite a bit to get the site to work on github.io.  It didn't like the file structure we were originally given and I had to flatten everything.  

Once again, no time to do the bonus.
